I can't believe we're nearly passing 2019.
_I mean c'mon, that means 2010 was almost 9 years ago._
It makes me think about how time flew by really quickly. I still remember exactly a year ago (I can't be too exact, but I'll write it anyway for dramatization), I was in Bandung for a family vacation, thinking what 2019 would bring to me. At that time, I hadn't realized that 2019 would be the year to me. _The_ year where I would get the biggest amount of experience, and difficult times that would lead me in learning some valuable lessons.

Amongst all new things that I've done in 2019, some of them were pretty exciting - getting my first internship, making and publishing my very own website (developing and deploying, if you fancy a more CS terminology, and yes I code it myself), starting a non-profit startup, and being part of the UI design team for COMPFEST. But apart from those very exciting opportunities, for the past semester, I had been going back and forth from my campus and my house.
Oh, you mean your apartment in Depok? No, I mean my actual house in West Jakarta, and if you actually do the math and a bit of Google Maps, the distance to campus is around 33km. Times that by 2 (back-forth) and multiply that by 20(days in a month) and 5 (months in a semester), and you got yourself a whopping 6600 kilometers covered in 1 semester.

And have I learned something from that? Oh, sure I have, if not I would not be here in my room writing about it.

So here are a few things I've learned from commuting 33 kilometers a day for 1 semester in 2019.

**1. Rely on Technology**<br/>
When I was still living in my apartment in Depok, I had not paid any attention to the weather forecast nor the traffic and schedules. I mean why would I? My apartment was only 5 minutes away from campus, and the rain was not a problem at all since I had raincoats and stuff. Class schedules were not much of a problem to me since waking up at 7:45 for an 8 am class was possible.
Ever since I started going Jakarta-Depok every day, I had been obsessed with productivity apps and relying my days on the power of these apps. I started planning out my days, every single one of my classes and meeting activities, breaks, commuting times, and assignment times. I used what I call "The Productivity Trinity" which are **Google Calendar - Todoist - Trafi**. This collection of apps had helped me through my rough year of commuting and planning every day. **Google Calendar** for mapping out and scheduling every hour of my day, **Todoist** for instant to-dos that are directly synced into my Google Calendar, and **Trafi** to check trains schedule.
Relying on these apps have never gotten me more aware of what's happening in life.
Don't get me wrong, I used to do all that in my head before I started commuting every day, but after I started commuting, I realized that I had quite a lot of things going on inside my head already that I needed to start utilizing these apps that I have on my phone to do the work. And maybe you should too.

**2. To Say No**<br/>
Commuting takes time.
It took around 2 hours to go from my house to campus by train. That means less time on campus and more time commuting in the same 24 hours. Before I started commuting, I would have spent all my mornings through my evenings on campus. Meetings, clubs, social activities, and even Saturday activities were filling up most of my weeks. After I started commuting, I decided to cut some of them, not because of me realizing what's important and what's less important, but because of me realizing that it was practically impossible. 8 hours of class, 4 hours of back-and-forth commute already took half of my day. In addition to that, I had a part-time Teaching Assistant (TA) job on campus that required me to do lab tutorials for 2 hours every week. That's 10 hours to do assignments AND sleep. Realizing that I couldn't do this for a whole semester makes me think about a way to fix things.
Since I couldn't really shorten my commute time (the train was the only option), I decided to cut my time on campus and went home by the time my last class was finished. So no more _chit-chat_ after class, and I cut all my activities from organizations that require weekly meetings and/or huge on-campus responsibilities.
How did I do that? Did I just cut out ALL of the activities that have on-campus meetings? Obviously not, I started ...

**3. Deciding based on impact**<br/>
Before I joined or accepted an invitation to be a part of an organization or a campus activity, I started thinking about impacts. A factor that I have never thought of in my life. Impacts here basically means **"what benefits and/or positive things that I can gain from this activity and also the negatives and how they might impact my life"**. Positive things can be anything, from connections to opportunities, and negatives can be anything from more time om campus (less time to work on assignments and sleep) to even more deadlines.
By practicing impact-centered thinking, I started to think about the activities I was about to join from a different perspective. So instead of deciding based on how prestigious that position might be, or how cool the event might be, try thinking this way, **by partaking in this event, what positive outcomes might impact my life, and what negative outcomes might also happen along the way?**
By thinking about impacts, I was able to cut and started saying no to several opportunities that were given to me. (for those that got declined by me, I'm so sorry, and now you know clearly why).

2019 sure has taught me important lessons, from as simple as relying on technology to changing my thinking paradigm. A simple activity such as commuting has taught me a lot of things this year and I hope that through my experience, You can learn more about not just life lessons, but life lessons from a student perspective.

_Here's to a better 2020_<br/>
